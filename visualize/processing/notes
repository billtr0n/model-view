notes:

have num_processes working on handling all of the processing tasks with each task in its own process or each taskgroup in its own
process, taskgroup allows to have tasks that must be completed in succession.  

Initially:
SimulationProcessingTask
    DynamicRuptureProcessingTask
    - plot kinematic fields, mu0, and far-field spectra, and slip-rates, and stresses at specified points on the fault from SORD code at points along the fault, one-point statistics, prepare csv file for R analysis and modeling. 
    Notes:
        - eventually SGSim and LMC fitting needs to be implemented in python, most likely this will be done immediately after SCEC.
        - need specified filetype to store matricies of coregionalization, so we can compute the average values and use the 'best fitting' version as well as compare with faults of different lengths.
    WavePropagationProcessingTask
    - plot PGA, PGV, selected seismograms and their acceleration spectra, make GMPE comparisons.


Think about different figures that I make and implement generalized plotting wrappers to make 
implementing plots of different things easier.




meeting notes:

- plot gmpe bias plots
- compute standard deviations for unilateral rupture.


compute mean. slip, mean. psv, mean.vrup, std. slip, std. psv, std.vrup, 
and correlations between everything.
